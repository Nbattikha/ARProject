The game uses Gyro action to move the background in the main menu
There's two levels to choose from, first has a small world, second has a bigger world.
Your objective is to drop the cops dead (and score 50), if however you dropped nurses dead and raised your red score to (10) you lose.
At the end of the game, you will get window to replay the game.

This project utilizes Gyroscope, Camera, Surface detection and real world integration.

Have a nice test.
